# WriteAid
This program allows users to learn how to write or draw with AR style stensils. The stensil is laid on something like a piece of paper through a camera, and the user can
adjust the placement of the stensil. The user can follow along, learning how to write or draw. Users can enter text in any languge, which is then translated to 
english and made into a stensil. Users can also upload their own images to be used as stensils. This app can be used to teach people how to write in english or draw.!
